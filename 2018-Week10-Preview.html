	<h2>Week 10 Preview</h2>
	<p>be fore we start I just like to say that was a stellar recap Brian for week 9. You have inspired me to make sure my week 10 preview can be just as good a your recap and I can only thank you and only you for the motivation of making my Weekly Preview Great...... now do us all a favor and make yourself useful this week by beating bobby. Meek VS Dugan: dugan sits in the six spot now right now by holding a tie breaker over dom and scoring more points then dennis team. But dennis and dugan play last week of the season and who knows that could be for a the six seed. But before count dugans chickens he should be worrying about taking care of business over 2 and 7 meek. Who he lost to a couple weeks ago . so can meek get a big game from brady, edlemen and brown to maybe knock dugan down peg who has couple red flags this week with samy being questionable and his TE to or will the Gurly Connor combo be to much to handle for meek.. Isaac VS Billy &amp; Isaac gotta be living the high life because he can do no wrong with QB he can play bree or Maholmes and he still can get the QB WR combo because eof Hill and Thomas who had 211 yards receiving last week. Also could this be big zeke week or are cowboys just hopeless and Mixon is sneaky good. As for Billy is the perfect week for he bears running combo as they play the shitty lions. Cam plays tonight on road in Pittsburg and will goden take be golden egg at Wide Receiver the eagle have been looking for this year.</p>
<p>Brock VS Dom - Big week for dom because it will suck to loose and fall two gms under the Mendoza line but there always hope with Rodgers looking to party hard at home VS the dolphins and what bout Kenan allen VS the raiders nothing blacking out on a Sunday rager in Oakland. As for brock Goff has been dynomyte and where still waiting for that barkly 200 combined total yards game with coulple of TDS could this be the week. And could the Jets defense put kink in doms plan like the da bears did last week. Bobby VS Brian : In the battle of the B's, Brian will hope Big ben has pretty solid Thursday night this week and Mccaffrey who is becoming a top 5 back can have him self a game. As for 1st place bobby he gotta pretty favorbile match up with matty ice in clevland and hunt VS Arizona. The real question becomes when does bobby throw the towel in with gronk and look for a new TE or is this the week gronk says oh hay guys !?!?!?!?.. remember me.</p>
<p>Lexi VS Dennis : NO caption how you like me now cousins this week as he sits on bye week. So doses that make deenis ripe for the pickings. Well Gordon and colman both have favorable match ups this week and maybe OBJ says hello remember me on Monday night football and its enough to sneak by. OR does lexi squeak one out because wentz sticks it to dallas and Kamara and ridley tear it up????.</p>
