	<h2>Week 11 Diaper Pail</h2>
	<p>There are many days we look forward to life because of the joy that can bring. For instance, weddings, parties, holidays and all sorts of other festivities give us a chance to be around people we care about and bring about cherished memories. We often don't know how these events will unfold until they happen, although in most cases we have a pretty reasonable idea of what to expect most of the time. Although many are anticipating these events with joy, we often don't take into account the anxiety that lies beneath them. That anxiety can lie within planning an event, knowing the presence of certain people make you cringe, or simply feeling an obligation to please others at your own expense. As Thanksgiving nears, I couldn't be happier to be taking my daughter to Connecticut to meet some new members of her extended family. They will be so happy to see her and she is likely to smile back at them out of pure chance or random muscle reflexes. Though as it nears, I've been praying all week that Nina will not throw a tantrum and cry for the entirety of the trip. It's also likely to be disruptive to her daily schedule, and who knows how she'll take it out of us throughout the day I could describe Sundays as the same thing. All week the build-up entices all sorts of thoughts and exceptions. Then, all Sunday I spend the day watching my phone in both constant fear and excitement at nearly every moment (although Thursdays simply now bring me fear). It's a weekly day to look forward to like any event, that will ultimately bring unimportantly stored great memories along with soul crushing and heart-breaking losses. Speaking of soul-crushing and heart-breaking losses, let us take a moment of silence to pay our respects to our good pal Meek. Although his match wasn't the closest, the 15 point margin was actually the smallest in a week of blowouts. Although you could blame many, I'll simply put the blame on Alshon Jeffrey. Here's a guy who is supposed to be a WR1, and has barely been a WR2 on most weeks. In a game that many expected to be a shootout, Jeffrey managed only 5.3 points (although to give him credit he might have been the highest scoring eagles receiver, I would check by why waste precious moments of my life on that trivial piece of information). Also, let's make sure to point out that Brock had 4 players combine for 6.6 points and still pulled out a win. So I guess Jeffrey wasn't so bad when you look on the other side. On that note, happy thanksgiving everyone! Good luck to everyone except Dom and please make sure not to discipline your children with your belt. http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/25342741/adrian-peterson-uses-belt-discipline-son</p>
