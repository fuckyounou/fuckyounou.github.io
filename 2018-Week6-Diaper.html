	<h2>Week 6 Diaper Pail</h2>
	<p>I'd first like to thank Brian, for consistently reminding me to write the column time and time again. If only I had someone in my life who was constantly telling me and reminding me to do many of my tasks and responsibilities, I'd be a happier man indeed. Your persistence has very much paid off and I'll surely lash out at you at the most random of moments. </p>
<p>As for the diaper pail, let's not overthink the room here, the matchup to chosen was obvious, as Dennis and Billy were within 2 points of each other. While both had mediocre weeks, (not meant as an insult, but 110 range seems to be a winnable or losable number unless your name happens be Jeffrey Dugan in which case every number is losable point total) Jordan Howard has certainly been a disappointment this season in terms of fantasy, while cohen has really been the guy that makes things happen. Granted Billy was smart enough to draft and start cohen, Jordan's 4.9 points is not gonna help you much, especially since he was a late 2nd round pick and they were playing the Miami Dolphins with Brock Osweiler at QB. Let me repeat that, Jordan Howard, managed 4.9 points against a team that has Brock Oswieler as the starting QB.... Let that sink in... Just because Billy drew the tough loss, let's not let some other notable putrid performances. Dom started a player that scored him -0.6 points in a half point ppr, decimal scoring league...... again, let that sink in..... meanwhile Brian lost to Dom who played a player that scored a negative point total..... Not to mention Brian played Kenyan Drake who fumbled the game winning touchdown... Good Luck to everyone this week except Dugan who is somewhere in Middletown ringing the river bell</p>
