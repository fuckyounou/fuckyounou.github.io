	<h2>Week 6 Recap</h2>
	<h3>The Impermanence of Man</h3>
<p>Consider the absurd coincidence of your existence. Billions of galaxies exist in our vast universe, each with a billion individual stars, that have been burning for billions of years. One such star happens to have a planet circling around it at just the right distance to allow the ideal temperatures for life to thrive. Millions of years of evolution and geological shifts have conspired to create humans. </p>
<p>We find ourselves here, after 100 thousand years of human development. 
Great monuments have been erected and crumbled to dust, civilizations have conquered the Earth and then fallen, and we've even had the audacity to reach beyond the bounds of our home planet to start probing the infinite depths of the universe around us. On our speck of dust in an infinite sea, we ignore our relative insignificance and aspire to achieve greatness. To what end? Our lives are a blip in the grand scheme of things. All great art will be lost, all accomplishments will be forgotten, all we have wrought will crumble into the sea. Entropy is the only law the universe obeys. Our lives, our legacies, our planet, our galaxy- all will vanish in the blink of a cosmic eye. </p>
<p>The universe itself will some day cease to be, as it spreads and expands until the finite energy within is stretched too thin to sustain any spark of light or warmth. Worry not about your bad beats, your week lows, and your lost seasons. In time it will all be erased as if it had never existed. Time relentlessly pulls us forward until we reach the end, a quiet end with no pomp or circumstance, with neither a bang nor a whisper.</p>
<h4>Everclear Ike vs Disgraced Goat</h4>
<p>Meeks bad luck escalates to Dugan levels this week with another loss. It looked like he had this one in the bag, and he was probably already prepping his victory dance when Mahomes and Tyreek came to town. Meanwhile Ike was in sunny Florida, blacked out in the 95 degree sun after a morning of binging grain alcohol, unaware that he ws breaking both a record and Meeks heart. Wishing you better luck in 2 weeks Meek, and Ike you've got us all wondering if you broke the October curse or are you just setting yourself up for th egreatest playoffs disappointment yet? </p>
<h4>Broken Bell vs 2 Doms 1 Cup</h4>
<p>A bad week for our hero this week as I finished off with the week low and a second loss to Dom. Dom can't feel too good about himslef though, if you're breaking a sweat on a Monday night wondering if you can beat 95 points there have to be some alarm Bells going off about your team. Garbage on both sides of the board this matchup with a last minute Rodgers TD saving him from disgrace. </p>
<h4>Billy vs Dennis</h4>
<p>Two uninspired team names here guys, give me something to work with. Uninspiring performances this week as well. Usually a contender for the week high, Billy had a mediocre game this week. Surprisingly his poor performance was not because he started 2 Chicago RBs, as Tarik Cohen probably saved him from the low score this week. Dennis eked out a win this week thanks to his lone stud Starvin Melvin, but adds to his injury woes as Cooper Kupp missed part of the game and for a minute looked like his season was over.</p>
<h4>Mr Magoo vs Lexie the Lady</h4>
<p>Dugan is feeling high and mighty this week after moving up to a whopping 2 wins on the season. Saved by Gurley and Conner, Dugan is still putting up points for now, but he's a Gurley injury away from deserving the spot he has in the cellar. If Bell comes back and Conner becomes a non factor then Dugan will truly have a team worthy of his name. The short sighted nature of his Bell trade proves that he really should be wearing his glasses when he looks at his roster, and probably shouldn't be able to drive anymore either. Meanwhile Lexie has a boom or bust team going from week high numbers to barely over 100 points this week. The return of Jamis the Manis helped her out this week but her WR corps is looking weak. Lex I sent you a little trade offer if you feel like remaining competitive for the rest of the season. </p>
<h4>Bobby Boucher vs Brock the Jock</h4>
<p>Big game from Bobby this week means we all had to put up with his endless gifs and insufferable bragging. Matty Ice did his thing this week and even sent a few balls Julios way. Kareem Hunt remains a beast as well, but the real star of the matchup was the Texans D who feasted on a weak Bills offense like they were a factory-farmed ribeye. Bock suffered from a bad game from Goff who couldn't get anything going against the Denver defense, but god Damn did Saquon look good on the field. Bock is selfishly hoarding two solid RBs and it's slim pickings for them on the waiver wire, he may be setting up for a playoff push. </p>
<p><strong>Survivor:</strong> A sad day for us all as I am removed from the survivor league as unceremoniously as I've been removed from various casino establishments over the years. Coming down to the wire now! Just Ike, Billy, Dennis and Bock remain. </p>
<p><strong>Week high:</strong> Bobby just barely ekes the week high from Ike, still a far cry from my impressive season high of 185.8.</p>
