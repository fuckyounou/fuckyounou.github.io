	<h2>Week 9 Preview</h2>
	<p>If the NFL would just abolish the Thursday night games my preview being posted today would be fine. But lets be real it is fine because it was two turds of teams playing I could expand on that but Iâll let bobby tell you why next time he writes the dump of the week. With that said things are starting to tighten up here as we enter week 9. The cream of the crop bobby and Brian will try to separate from the rest of the league going forward and Isaac trying to catch them for that bye week in the playoffs. Meanwhile the battle for the 5th and 6th seed are just starting to heat up. Right now brock and dom hold the last two spots with me and dennis on there tails and possibly even thou they both have 6 losses Mr.Hage &amp; Mrs.Hage lurking but hope might still be there in some kind of way. Dom VS Dugan â in what is big game for both teams this week and loss by dom could be brutal in the fact that I will have tie breaker over him for beating him twice this year. But with that said Aron Rodgers might have party tonight in primetime and can AP keep on chugging along. Did you know he was offered in orginal offer for bell but I didnât not want him figuring it was just a fluke. Boy was I wrong mean while Phillup is in seattle which is always a tough place to play and can I continue to get a another good weeks out of sammy and Jackson going forward.</p>
<p>Brock VS Billy â speaking of Thursday night brock TE didnât take a dump and sneakly put up 18 points to get the week started. It might be tough sledding though with both crazy obj and barkly on bye week. Meanwhile billy has steady old Cam this week in favarble match up VS tampa and Cohen in buffalo and Parker against a very shaky jets secondary/ Lexi VS Bobby- Digs is out but with that said can fitzmagic save here season? Will kamara have a day to rember and can old Cobb show up for one more magical night in New England to keep here season alive. Mean while bobby could just hum along with matty ice and juilo and JU JU this week.</p>
<p>Brian VS Isaac â last week I repaid the favor to Ike and knocked him out of first palce this week he can get right back on the saddle by knocking brian off. With that said thou Brian has Rosthlisberger looking to redeem himself against a Raven defsense that is falling apart and Mcaffrey and thielen might have big week as well. Man is Brians team good. Meanwhile Isaac has Mahomes and Thomas and Hill both going against not great defenses and all those guys are home. There nothing like some home cookingâ¦.AM I RIGHT IKE? Dennis VS Mark â this could be the brady Edleman week after Monday night when the Pats played everything close to the vest because they played shiity buffalo and didnât want to show anything. By the way congrats on beating your brother last week to. Also adams and I feel like the brown might have party as well. As for Dennis Melvin has tough game on the road in seattle is chubb really a starter and Kupp might have big afternoon but can you really trust Miller in you flex this week and Hopkins on the road?</p>
