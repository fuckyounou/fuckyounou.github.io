	<p>For some reason, it looks like everyone decided to quit on their final columns. Everyone quits for their own reasons: shame, exhaustion, lack of enthusiasm, among just a few. But this season, we saw one man rise among defeat to keep trying, Meek. A still broken man, Meek would not …</p>

	<p>There are many days we look forward to life because of the joy that can bring. For instance, weddings, parties, holidays and all sorts of other festivities give us a chance to be around people we care about and bring about cherished memories. We often don't know how these events …</p>

	<p>So far, our daughter has been pretty good to us. She gives us a good 6 hour stretch of sleep, then intervals of 2-3 hours, she doesn't cry very often unless she's hungry or we do her stretches for her stiff neck, and she normally pleasant with smiles and baby …</p>

	<p>Week 8 of the season, week 10 with my daughter, and other than trying to figure out if my daughter is smiling at me or having a muscle spasm in her face, my 6-2 record seems to be something I can always smile about. Nothing wipes a smile off someone's …</p>

	<p>Not a lot of drama this week, other than the yelling and screaming that inevitably went down in the Dugan household on Monday Night. Makes you wonder, does Sarah take the time to find out why Dugan is yelling and screaming and console him, or does she simply ignore him …</p>

	<p>This diaper goes to a very, very grumpy man, none other than Jeffrey Dugan! Dugan traded his best assets behind Gurley for two players, one of which rode his bench, Freeman, while the other would have been better off joining his fellow trade-mate on the bench, Amari Cooper. It pains …</p>

	<p>Now that week 4 is OVER (Jeffrey), we once again the nail-biter of a performance came down to the last 2 minutes of MNF. At least this time, I was able to come out on the good side of that exchange. Needless to say, although all the action was on …</p>
