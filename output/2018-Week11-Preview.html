	<h2>Week 11 Preview</h2>
	<p>Fuck sake this computer is slow. I litterly just sat here waiting 5 mins for this Microsoft word to open up. Any how ITS WEEK 11 and as in brains recap he wrote about numbers I know nothing bout number I failed math in college litterly every time I took it except for summer course where I had bobby do the take home tests for me. i cant even get the week right in a half ass preview. but I got my self a extordary snicker doodle hot choacalte from starbucks and I am here to give you all the preview your deserve with your morning coffe... it better be better coffe then dunkin or starbuck I hope you all have nice coffe shop or your own coffe ninja and sip on nice cup of hot coffe. So as we stand the final playoff spot is 4 way tie with 3 teams each at 5 -5 and with me trailing by one game with only tie breaker over dominics low scoring luck clover up his ass team. But I still have to play dennis and brock who two of 4 teams I have not played yet. I also have loss to billy who is 4th team at 5 &amp; 5. Brian VS Dugan : we bet something on this a name change I think. But lets cut to the chase big ben is up against a jags defense that hasn't been great at all last week he put up 50 points as he laid the smack down on bobby. Lets also not foget he got mccaffrey up against a crappy lions run defense and and he rocking the rams wide outs this week with woods and evan against kc defens that gives up points. As for me. Philip and gurly and connor if he is healthy are no brain point scoreds but he question marks come in at wr with sammy who has good matchup but will he play and desean Jackson who is hit or miss vs a not greats giants team.</p>
<p>Meek VS Brock : Meek the freak looking to make it 2 in a row and is off pretty good start this week with Thursday night performances by willson and devante adams but with shady on a bye coing off his best week can he get enough points from miller martin and Jeffrey to tocompete with goff and barkly and Thomas and for brock could he miss obj ? this week against a team that cant stop me in tampa Birthday Girl VS Dom : What could be the greatest birthday present ever then beating your brother in law who got 30 points so far from Rodgers but was only able to muster 1.3 from some other packer because Rodgers was to busy throwing to devante adams, tho allan and cook could stir the pot enough this week for dom and maybe even a vintage perfromace form larry. But lexi gotta be hoping for big game from wentz in the dome vs an ok saints defense and some birthday karma from kamara and riddly.</p>
<p>Bobby VS Billy : bobby went shoping at the thrift shop and is hoping he bought a vintage Matt Ryan and Julio performance this week. Along with mr.mack all dressed in black with silver buttons all down his back but with billy getting 34 points from jones and locket doses bobby have enough for fire power to out score cam, cohen and david Johnson. Dennis VS Isaac : Come Monday night there could be barn burner in LA and man at the helm could be the one and only patty malhomes busting out hits to ty hill. Did I mettion Isaac also has zeke who looks to be getting his mojo back and dial tone micheal Thomas and sneaky glass of mixon. As for his oppenet is rolling out his eli obj connection and Hopkins has very tough matchup vs Washington defense the question we have to ask ourselves here does he have enough fire power this week to even compete.</p>
