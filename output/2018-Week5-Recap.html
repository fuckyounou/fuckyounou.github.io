	<h2>Week 5 Recap</h2>
	<p>What does it mean to be first? It can mean a lot of things. It could mean you're the best of the best, the greatest fanstasy football player ever born, destined to a championship and all the ancillary prizes. It could be a temporary bout of luck, a quick glimpse at the top before you Ike your way down to a disappointing finish. Sometimes it all comes down to strength of schedule and having a streak of low points against. And sometimes, every once in a while, when you're able to pull out a win and come close to the week high despite losing a stud like Brandon Cooks to a concussion, it means you are truly legendary- a force to be reckoned with. </p>
<h4>Shootin Down Brees vs Briming Foam</h4>
<p>Let's all pause the preview for 5-10 minutes to really congratulate Drew Brees on his new record and give him some time with his family. No really, we've got nothing else better to do, we'll wait. Ike looks like he's returning to his natural state after a second loss in a row, could this be the beginning of the same old pattern for Ike or can he break the mold? Brees did put up the points on Monday, although luckily he did not look Michael Tomas' way too often. The rest of his squad was certainly lacking luster, and he was not helped by a rams defense who let the Seahawks keep their game close.</p>
<h4>Champion Meek vs Grumpy Dugan</h4>
<p>Meek finally pulled out a win this season in spectacular fashion. It's a shame to see a good losing streak come to an end but I'll take a surly Jeffrey over a depressed Meek any day. Brady did his thing and carried Meek to a high score this week along with some help from Antonio Brown and Devante Adams. Dugan had an impressive showing from Gurley and Conner and thought he had the week wrapped up tighter than the condoms Sarah makes him use. In the end though Reed's terrible QB could not muster up the handful of points Dugan needed for the win.</p>
<h4>Bobbys World vs Billy the Kid</h4>
<p>Bobby finally had to pay the Troll Toll this week, with a pathetic performance that his infant daughter probably could have beat. Billy stays lucky with an insane 22 points from the Bengals defense who had negative points in their previous two games, good call there Billy. Perhaps this loss will shame Bobby into dropping his trolling strategy before he faces me. </p>
<h4>Polaroid Kamara vs Little Brock</h4>
<p>It's not all songs and dancing at the Hage home as Lexie couldn't bring home the win this week. At least she can't blame herself for starting the wrong players since nobody on her bench did much either. Bock came within a fraction of a point of the week high thanks to a beastly game from Saquon Barkley who's been having a monster rookie year, and Odell Beckham who must have remembered this week that he's supposed to be good at football. This is a rare week where Brocks all-Giants offense strategy paid off, enjoy it while you can.</p>
<h4>Stay at Home Dom vs Dennis the Mediocre</h4>
<p>Dom pulled out a win this week despite getting nothing from Quincy or Baldwin. Can he thank his many trades for the win? Nope, those guys remain on the bench while his victory was brought by his only decent picks of the draft in Rodgers and Ertz, plus a nice little something from TJ Yeldon. Dennis probably wishes he had handcuffed Yeldon because he is really missing Fournette. When you have to start Bilal Powell in your flex spot you might as well give up. </p>
<p><strong>Week High:</strong> In a true rags to riches story that will warm your hearts, Meek the Dugan Slayer takes home the week high with 141. Brock gets absolutely nothing for his second place finish of 140.9. The season high overall is still an impressive 185.8. </p>
<p><strong>Survivor Pool:</strong> Bobby bites the dust this week and the pool is down to 5. Brian, Ike, Brock, Billy and Dugan remain.</p>
