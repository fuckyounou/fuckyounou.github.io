	<h2>Week 10 Diaper Pail</h2>
	<p>So far, our daughter has been pretty good to us. She gives us a good 6 hour stretch of sleep, then intervals of 2-3 hours, she doesn't cry very often unless she's hungry or we do her stretches for her stiff neck, and she normally pleasant with smiles and baby coos. My wife calls her a "show baby," because whenever we have guests she often smiles and plays with everyone and she doesn't cry when we hand her off to anyone. Life could not be better when you feel like you have everything rolling. </p>
<p>That sort of feels like what happened this week to my team I was willing to brag and show off my fantasy team to anyone willing to listen. It was my "other" pride and joy in my life, my "stacked" 7-2 fantasy football team. I'd talk myself blue with my friend at work; we talk Fantasy Football shop often before even greeting each other sometimes. Feels good when you got something wonderful in your life. Only to realize that sometimes, life is not peachy as it seems. Whether it's getting your arse handed to you on Thursday Night and losing hope, or going out on your first night without your child only to come home to a child who hasn't slept all night when she normally is out cold for several hours only to keep you up every couple hours after a night of casual drinking. It's a swift and painful reminder that despite feeling like you can touch the stars, life will undoubtedly bring you back crashing down to earth in the hardest of ways. Our friend Brock found that the hard way. </p>
<p>After betting hard on the Jets like a Jeffrey owned Las Vegas Super Bowl futures bet, Brock watched what was still a good lead evaporate in the second half to the heroics of Zach Ertz. It would be easy to blame the Jets playing the putrid bills team that everyone bets against, but it is only masks the true culprit. Look down Brock's lineup and you'll see Sony Michel return to the lineup and get 3.1 fantasy points. Even Nyhiem Hines' 3.7 total would have gotten him a win, but why would you play a backup player when you can play a starting a player, albeit a time-share, on your favorite team in first place. Brock is likely writing hate-mail to Todd Bowles this week and writing to the NFL to get a stat correction in favor of a single sack from the Jets defense; but he should be looking in the mirror and wondering why Michel couldn't muster more than 3.1 fantasy points. Anyway, good luck to everyone but Billy this week.</p>
