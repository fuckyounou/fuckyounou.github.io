	<h2>Week 12 Preview</h2>
	<p>Thanks giving is here and that means there only two weeks of the regular season left for us fantasy dreamers out there. The top three teams in Isaac, Brian and Robert are all but playoff bound but after that its just a mess with three teams at 6 - 5 and dennis 5 -6 and me lerking at 4 - 7 but most likely a long shot. While the husbend and wife Mark and Lexi round out the bottom of cellar. Though Mark gave it a valiant effert in all most getting right back into the playoff hunt. With that said let lets look at each team and I'll tell you what there thanfull about . Brees w Mahomes - Stealing both Maholmes and Brees in the draft and also getting both of there main targets. Ram Ram Thank You Ma'am - Two white players one being a Wr and the other a running back. This man has no problem drafting white dudes unlike our comishner. Thrift Shop - Andrew Luck but def not Gronk David Johnsons Golden Taint- if anything he thankful dom only allows family or close relitives to join our league to replace people who leave. Winner - Having a horse shoe up his ass Little Giaints - Goff and shedding the thought of having to giaints weekly in his lineup. Champ - well he won last years so he thankfull for that I would think. Sipping on a Gurly - Connor and Gurley From Goat to Glory - Devante Adams, Brown, and ruining my fucking season Insant Kamara drafting Kamara and Calvin Ridley</p>
<p>Now on to the week 12 preview: Dugan VS Brock - The giants have ruined many days in my life and I cant help to fear that they will be my down fall in any chanced of having a shot at the playoffs in week 13. You see it was victor cruz on christmass many years ago, last week with allowing Mike evans to score 30 billion fucking points ( yes I know my team was garbage too ) and how I have stated many times in the preview before barkly will have 200 plus all around game and I cant help to think this will be the week. Meek VS billy - Billy at 6 - 5 will look to lock up the playoff spot this week and how can you not love his two headed bears running backs against the lions defense and if AJ Green plays this week him VS a naughty browns team. Meek will have punchers chance thou with Brown and adams you never know when both these guys can go off for 30 plus. Isaac VS Lexi - poor lexi thinking she checking in on Isaac on bye with no maholmes and hll but he just fills that spot with brees and Thomas and we totollay forgot bout zeke who has been getting fed a lot last couple weeks. As for lexi she will need a big game from wentz and and couple of here Wrs I think this week to even pull off and upset.</p>
<p>Bobby VS Dom - this could be the week the NFL rembers Gronk is still on the Pats and that could spell double trouble for dom with juilo playing in a dome and luck who is def back. As for dom Rodgers hasn't been super but maybe he will feel like ruining the Viking season in a revenge game and what becomes of AP now that they don't have alex smith. Dennis VS Brian - Brian has been rolling like a gaint tornado thru the league the last two weeks with big ben putting up 25 plus last two weeksna mccaffrey who is consitantly solid and Evans who plays another shitty team this week in SF.</p>
