	<h2>Week 8 Preview</h2>
	<p>Its finally here, the half way point of the season. We could be further along but since I never make the playoffs I never sure if the playoffs go thru week 17. Many things have happened through 7 weeks of football. I could sit here and complain but ill leave that for Sunday when I score 200 points and Isaac scores 201. Speaking of Isaac lets take a look at the cream of the crop going into week 8. Four teams sit at 5 â 2 Isaac, Robert, billy and brian. Who is the best 5 â 2 team? Iâll tell you in second after I glance through the rosters real quickâ¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦â¦.. And Iâm back man the service is slow and the wi-fi sucks where im sitting but with further review its Isaac with slight edge over Brian. I like the fact Isaac each week can mix and match his QB match ups and still double the points with hill or Thomas and brain comes in close 2nd becaue thielen and cooks and with wild card of having ingram back in his line up and drake who is on his bench this week has been good except for two weeks in the middle of season when he didnât get more then 2.5 points.</p>
<p>Dugan VS Isaac â Last week I put up 2nd most points only to loose again. No rivers this week but with conor back and gurly doing his thing can I get enough production from my qb to hopfully keep me in it against Isaac who you know Patrick and Hill are gonna tear it up and I could say oh hay Thomas is on the road this week but he still playing in dome. So can Isaac up word tick in October continue of will he swoon one last week before November is here. </p>
<p>Billy VS Brian â in a loser leaves 1st place match up this week Billy has some favorable matchups this week with Hilton, green, kelce but what intrests me most is he playing two bears running backs this week. Will that hurt him? And as for brian big ben is home that could be brake out game VS browns team that I think is on the decline and with some tough matchups for his WR evans against the bangels the rest of this guys could explode even shitty Jordan reed vs giants team that traded half its defense away.</p>
<p>Big Bro VS Lil Bro â in the battle for hages or maybe winner is the 2019 commish? ( just throwing that out there) Will this be week doms luck runs out and Meek gets little more love from brady and edlemen and maybe a brown goes off for 20 points. As for dom how long can you count on AP and yeldon. Robinson could torch the jets defense but then there his Tight ends two tigtends going against angry jags defense and sturdy bengals defenseâ¦. MEEK 2019!!!!!!! </p>
<p>Dennis VS bobby â Luck, Hunt, Mack and throw in JU JU is a lot better then having two Texans in your starting lineup who has a qb who had to take a bus ride to the game last week. Poor dennis suffering for superbowl hangover. Last week he forgot to bench Melvin this week he on a bye and his only hope may be cousin goes off and then he can come rub in in everyones face screaming HOW DO YOU LIKE ME NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!! </p>
<p>Lexi VS Brock â lose here prob ends lexi season so can she get big game for Alvin and digs and hope Winston can put up some points vs the bengals. Also white could have big game Monday in buffalo for the patriots. But as for brock goff could thrown 5 TDs and barkly and obj could have a party but who know what he can get from the little giants who are now throwing away the season. Can lexi save here season or will the little giants be to much to handle</p>
